## Risk Analysis

### Market Risks

**Risk**: Associations can't afford equipment
- **Mitigation**: Lease-to-own and revenue share models; equipment pays for itself in 1 season

**Risk**: Parents won't pay for streams
- **Mitigation**: Pilot programs prove economics; low price point ($5-7); quality guarantee

**Risk**: Seasonal business (sports only 6-9 months/year)
- **Mitigation**: Multi-sport approach (year-round coverage); tournament revenue in off-season

### Operational Risks

**Risk**: Equipment failures at games
- **Mitigation**: Backup equipment for each region; rapid replacement program; extended warranties

**Risk**: Installation/training bottleneck
- **Mitigation**: Train association volunteers; hire regional field techs; video tutorials

**Risk**: Support load scales faster than capacity
- **Mitigation**: Self-service knowledge base; tiered support; regional support teams

### Financial Risks

**Risk**: Equipment inventory costs
- **Mitigation**: Pre-orders before bulk purchase; lease financing; just-in-time inventory

**Risk**: Video hosting costs exceed projections
- **Mitigation**: Variable cost passes through pricing; optimize CDN; volume discounts

## Market Opportunity

### Target Market

## Revenue Model

### Platform Fees
**Primary**: Transaction fee on every stream purchase
- 15-20% platform fee per transaction
- Camera owner keeps 80-85%
- You handle all payment processing, hosting, infrastructure

**Example**:
- Viewer pays $7 for stream
- Stripe fee: -$0.51 (2.9% + $0.30)
- Platform fee (20%): -$1.40
- Camera owner receives: $5.09
- Your revenue: $1.40 per stream

### Revenue Projections

- Average 2 games/week per owner
- 10 viewers per game at $7 each
- 20% platform fee
- Weekly: 100 cameras × 2 games × 10 viewers × $1.40 = $2,800
- **Monthly Revenue: $11,200**
- **Annual Revenue: $134,400**

**Moderate Scenario** (500 active camera owners):
- Average 2 games/week per owner
- 12 viewers per game at $7 each
- 20% platform fee
- Weekly: 500 cameras × 2 games × 12 viewers × $1.40 = $16,800
- **Monthly Revenue: $67,200**
- **Annual Revenue: $806,400**

**Aggressive Scenario** (1,000 active camera owners):
- Average 3 games/week per owner

- 20% platform fee
- Weekly: 1,000 cameras × 3 games × 15 viewers × $1.60 = $72,000

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

#### 1. Web Platform (Next.js/React)
- User dashboard for camera owners
- Game scheduling and QR code generation
- Revenue tracking and analytics
- Payout management

#### 2. Payment Processing
- Stripe Connect (for marketplace payments)
- Apple Pay / Google Pay integration
- Text-to-pay: Multiple implementation options
  - **SMS Payment Links**: Viewer texts keyword → receives payment link
  - **Stripe Payment Links**: Pre-generated, unique per game
  - **Twilio Integration**: Two-way SMS for payment confirmation
  - **Link.me/Fast Checkout**: One-tap mobile checkout URLs
- Automatic splits (platform fee vs. owner earnings)

#### 3. Video Infrastructure
- RTMP ingestion from cameras
- HLS/WebRTC conversion for browser playback
- CDN delivery (CloudFront or Mux)
- Quality monitoring and auto-refunds

#### 4. Camera Integrations
- **Veo**: RTMP external streaming (already supported)
- **Pixellot**: API/SDK integration for stream access
- Universal: Any RTMP-enabled camera

### Text-to-Pay Technical Implementation

#### Option 1: Twilio SMS Gateway (Recommended for MVP)
**How it works**:
1. Purchase dedicated phone number via Twilio ($1-2/month)
2. Customer texts keyword to number
3. Twilio webhook triggers your API
4. Generate Stripe Payment Link for that specific game
5. Send SMS with payment link
6. After payment, send SMS with stream access link

**Cost**: $1/month + $0.0079 per SMS (2 SMS per transaction = ~$0.02)

**Implementation**:
```
User: Text "WATCH EAGLES" to (555) 123-4567
System: Receives inbound SMS via Twilio webhook
API: Looks up "EAGLES" game, creates Stripe Payment Link
Response SMS: "Eagles vs Tigers tonight 7pm - $7 to watch live: https://pay.fieldview.live/abc123"
User: Clicks link, pays with Apple Pay
System: Webhook from Stripe confirms payment
Response SMS: "Payment confirmed! Watch here: https://fieldview.live/stream/abc123"
```

#### Option 2: Stripe Payment Links + SMS Shortener
**How it works**:
1. Pre-generate Stripe Payment Links for each game
2. Use SMS link shortener (Bitly API, TinyURL)
3. When user texts in, respond with shortened payment link
4. Stripe handles payment, redirects to stream

**Cost**: Free tier available, scales with usage

#### Option 3: Premium - Direct Carrier Billing
**How it works**:
1. Partner with carrier billing aggregator (Bango, Boku)
2. Charge directly to phone bill
3. Higher fees (30-40%) but frictionless for users
4. Popular internationally where card adoption is lower

**Cost**: 30-40% transaction fee (vs 2.9% for Stripe)
**Best for**: Future international expansion

### SMS Message Templates

**Initial Payment Request**:
```
"[Team1] vs [Team2] - [Date/Time]
Watch live for $[X]
Pay: [short-link]
FieldView.Live"
```

**Payment Confirmation + Stream Access**:
```
"✓ Payment received!
Watch now: [stream-link]
Questions? Reply HELP
Refund policy: [link]"
```

**Pre-Game Reminder** (for repeat customers):
```
"[Team] plays in 30 min!
Watch live: [payment-link]
Or reply WATCH to subscribe"
```

| **Total Fixed** | **$50-150/month** | - |

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

### Market Risks
**Risk**: Camera owners don't see value
- **Mitigation**: Free first 10 games; prove ROI before charging platform fees

**Risk**: Viewers won't pay for streams
- **Mitigation**: Camera owners set their own prices; optimize with A/B testing

### Competitive Risks
**Risk**: Veo/Pixellot build competing solution
- **Mitigation**: Better UX, faster iteration, superior education/support

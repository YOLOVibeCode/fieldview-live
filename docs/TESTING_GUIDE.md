---

### 📊 Test 6: Viewer Analytics

**Objective**: View active viewer list

**Steps**:
1. While logged in as admin, locate **"Active Viewers"** panel
2. Open a **new incognito window**
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/direct/tchs`
4. Fill in chat unlock form (any email/name)
5. Go back to admin panel
6. Wait ~10 seconds for refresh

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Total Active Count increases
- ✅ New viewer appears in list
- ✅ Green status indicator shows "active"
- ✅ Last seen time shows "Just now"
- ✅ Viewer name and email are displayed

---

### 💳 Test 7: Enhanced Paywall Modal

**Objective**: Test paywall with admin message, saved-card detection, and the inline Square checkout

**Prerequisites**: Enable paywall in admin panel first
- Set **Paywall Enabled**: ON
- Set **Price**: $4.99
- Set **Custom Message**: "Support our team! Your contribution helps us stream more games."

**Steps**:
1. Open **new incognito window**
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4300/direct/tchs`
3. Paywall modal should appear automatically

**Test Scenario A - New User**:
1. Fill in email: `newuser@test.com`
2. Fill in first name: `Test`, last name: `User`
3. Click **"Continue to Payment"** (calls `POST /api/direct/{slug}/checkout` to create the purchase, then advances to the inline checkout step)
4. Verify custom message is displayed
5. Complete the real inline Square checkout (no page redirect): a Square-hosted card field renders, plus one-tap **Apple Pay / Google Pay** buttons on supported devices (Apple Pay = Safari/iOS, Google Pay = Chrome/Android). The `SquareWalletPayment` component loads the Square Web Payments SDK.
6. Enter a Square sandbox test card (`4111 1111 1111 1111`, any future expiry / CVC / ZIP) and click **"Pay $4.99"** — the SDK tokenizes in-browser and charges via `POST /api/public/purchases/{id}/process`; on success the stream unlocks in place.

**Test Scenario B - Returning User**:
1. Fill in email: `saved-payment@test.com`
2. Fill in first name: `Saved`, last name: `User`
3. When a card is already on file for that email, an informational **"Saved Payment Found"** badge (card brand + last four) appears beneath the form — driven by `GET /api/direct/{slug}/payment-methods`
4. Click **"Continue to Payment"** and complete the charge with the inline Square form as in Scenario A (the badge is informational; the SDK still tokenizes the entered/wallet card)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Modal displays price correctly
- ✅ Admin custom message is prominent
- ✅ Saved-card detection badge appears when a card is on file for the email
- ✅ Inline Square checkout renders (card field + Apple Pay / Google Pay where supported)
- ✅ A successful charge unlocks the stream in place
- ✅ Can navigate back to edit info (the **"Edit"** link)

---

### 📧 Test 8: Email Notifications

**Objective**: Verify email reminders work

**Prerequisites**: Configure stream with scheduled time

**Steps**:
1. In admin panel, set **Scheduled Start Time**: 5 minutes from now
2. Register as a viewer (provide email)
3. Wait ~5 minutes
4. Check Mailpit at `http://localhost:8025`

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Registration confirmation email sent immediately
- ✅ Reminder email sent 5 minutes before stream
- ✅ Emails have beautiful HTML templates
- ✅ Links work correctly

---

### 🔐 Test 9: Producer Password Access

**Objective**: Test community editing with password protection

**Steps**:
1. As admin, in Producer Panel settings (if visible), set **Producer Password**: `producer123`
2. **Log out or use incognito window**
3. Navigate to Producer Panel section
4. Enter producer password: `producer123`
5. Verify you can edit scoreboard

**Test Scenario - No Password**:
1. As admin, **remove producer password** (set to empty)
2. In new window, verify Producer Panel is **immediately unlocked**
3. Anyone can edit without password

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Password-protected mode requires correct password
- ✅ No-password mode = instant access for anyone
- ✅ Admin JWT always bypasses password

---

### 🎮 Test 10: Corner Peek Chat

**Objective**: Verify chat UI works smoothly

**Steps**:
1. Close admin panel (to see full page)
2. Look for **floating chat badge** (bottom-right corner)
3. Click badge to open chat
4. Verify chat panel expands (360px x 500px)
5. Close chat by clicking X or backdrop
6. Verify smooth animations

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Badge is always visible in corner
- ✅ Panel expands smoothly
- ✅ Backdrop overlay appears
- ✅ Close button works
- ✅ Backdrop click closes chat

## 🧪 Automated Testing

### Run Unit Tests (Backend)

cd /Users/admin/Dev/YOLOProjects/fieldview.live/apps/api
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://fieldview:dev_password_change_in_production@localhost:4302/fieldview_dev"
export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:4303"
export JWT_SECRET="test-secret-key"
export WEB_URL="http://localhost:4300"
npx vitest run --config vitest.live.config.ts scoreboard.test.ts paywall-saved-payments.test.ts email-notifications.test.ts viewer-analytics.test.ts
```

**Expected**: All 48 tests passing

### Run E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
cd /Users/admin/Dev/YOLOProjects/fieldview.live/apps/web
npx playwright test tests/e2e/scoreboard.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/paywall.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/viewer-analytics.spec.ts
npx playwright test tests/e2e/chat-integration.spec.ts
```

**Expected**: All 53 tests passing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Scoreboard not appearing
- **Check**: Is `isVisible` set to true in admin panel?
- **Check**: Does the stream have a scoreboard initialized?

### Issue: Clock not syncing
- **Check**: Is `clockStartedAt` timestamp being set?
- **Check**: Refresh page and verify clock continues from correct time

### Issue: Viewer analytics showing 0
- **Check**: Has anyone registered/unlocked chat in last 2 minutes?
- **Check**: Is `lastSeenAt` updating on heartbeat?

### Issue: Emails not sending
- **Check**: Is Mailpit running on port 1025?
- **Check**: Is cron job running? (Check server logs)
- **Check**: Is `scheduledStartAt` set correctly?

### Issue: Paywall not showing
- **Check**: Is `paywallEnabled` set to true in admin panel?
- **Check**: Is `priceInCents` greater than 0?
